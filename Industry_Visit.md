# Industry Talk & Visit

## 📌 Description
As part of the Technology and Information System course, I engaged in industrial learning sessions to bridge the gap between academic concepts and real-world IT applications. This included a discussion session with UTMDigital and an in-depth analysis of PPG Industries' IT operations.

### 1. UTMDigital Session: Building Digital Systems
On October 29, I attended a discussion session presented by **Dr. Helmee Bin Yaacob** from UTMDigital. He delivered an in-depth perspective on how to build digital systems efficiently, with a strong focus on the **Agile methodology**. Dr. Helmee highlighted the importance of continuous communication between developers and clients to ensure the accuracy and quality of the final product, supported by a practical example showcasing the development stages of the **UTMSMART** application.

### 2. PPG Industry Talk: Global IT Operations
I also explored the IT framework of **PPG Industries**, a global leader in paints and coatings. The session highlighted how their IT department operates through specialized **Centers of Excellence (CoE)** to support global business operations. Key areas discussed included:
* **Data Analytics:** Using data to drive business decisions and improve efficiency.
* **Global Infrastructure:** Managing cloud computing and server connectivity worldwide.
* **SAP Systems:** Integrating core business processes (like manufacturing and finance) into a unified Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

## 💭 Reflection

### 1. What I gained:
* **Methodologies in Action:** From Dr. Helmee's session, I learned how the **Agile methodology** is applied in real projects like UTMSMART to maintain flexibility and quality.
* **Corporate IT Structure:** The PPG analysis helped me understand how large multinational companies organize their IT departments (Data Analytics, Infrastructure, SAP) to support business prosperity.
* **The Human Element:** Beyond technical skills, I realized that passion and psychological well-being are key drivers for creativity and consistency in the tech workspace.

### 2. Suggestions for improvement:
* **Bridging the Gap:** It became clear that industry expectations can differ from classroom learning. To improve, I suggest more sessions that simulate real-world "problem-solving" scenarios faced by companies like PPG.
* **Direct Engagement:** Having more Q&A opportunities with industry practitioners (like Dr. Helmee) allows for a deeper understanding of the challenges developers face daily.
