# PC Assembly Workshop

## 📌 Description
This semester I participated in a PC assembly session as part of my ICT (Information & Communication Technology) course. It was an excellent opportunity to understand component configuration, hardware functionality, and compatibility standards.

The experience gave me a broader perspective on troubleshooting, organizing work steps, and systematically building a complete system from scratch.

This type of practical application reinforces the real-world application of theoretical content and will help me develop deeper technical skills in the future.
