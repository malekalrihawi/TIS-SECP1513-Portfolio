# Industry Talk: PPG Global 🎨

## My first Industry Talk experience at UTM 🚀

On **November 20th**, I had the privilege of attending my very first industry talk at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**, featuring the global giant, **PPG**.

While most know PPG for their paints and coatings, I was fascinated to look under the hood and see how their IT Department acts as the engine keeping this massive organization running.

### 💡 Key Pillars of Operations
The session broke down how three core pillars support their global operations:
- **🔹 Data Analytics:** Transforming complex, unstructured data into strategic, long-term business decisions.
- **🔹 Global IT Infrastructure:** The backbone that connects PPG’s branches worldwide through seamless cloud services.
- **🔹 SAP Team:** The integrators who ensure all business departments speak the same language through unified ERP systems.

### 💭 Reflection
It was an eye-opening realization of just how vital IT is to the health of a manufacturing powerhouse. Inspired by these insights, my team and I created a poster to summarize our key takeaways.
