# Industry Talk: Project Management & System Development

## "Stop being a coder, start being a System Architect." 💡

That was the key takeaway from an eye-opening session I attended on **Dec 18th** featuring **Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib**, Head of Tech & Innovation at **Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd.**

### 📝 Session Overview
The talk focused on Project Management and System Development, going far beyond the basics. While we covered the fundamentals of **SDLC** (Waterfall vs. Agile), the real highlight was the shift towards **Agentic Coding**.

Mr. Abdul emphasized a reality check for us as Computer Science students:

- **🤖 Embrace AI:** Productivity can soar **10x** when we utilize AI effectively.
- **🧠 Shift Mindset:** The goal isn't just to write code anymore, but to manage AI to build systems for us.
- **⚠️ Risk Management:** With great power comes great responsibility. Human oversight is critical to prevent AI-generated errors in critical business systems.

> *"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail."*

### 💭 Reflection
This session truly shifted my perspective on what employers are looking for. It made me realize that the industry demands more than just syntax knowledge; it requires the ability to **architect solutions** using modern tools responsibly.
