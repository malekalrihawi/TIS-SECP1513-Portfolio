### 🏭 The Manufacturing Process
The visit focused on the **Drug Product (DP)** building, where insulin production is carried out. I learned about the detailed production cycle:
1.  **Fermentation:** The process begins with the fermentation of *Pichia* yeast.
2.  **Purification:** This is followed by purification and crystallization to produce insulin in powdered form.
3.  **Processing:** The drug substance is converted back into liquid, filled into cartridges, and rigorously inspected to ensure quality and the absence of impurities.
4.  **Final Steps:** The final stage involves pen assembly, labeling, packing, and preparation for distribution.

> **⚠️ Note:** Due to company policy and confidentiality regulations, photography inside the manufacturing facility was strictly prohibited.
