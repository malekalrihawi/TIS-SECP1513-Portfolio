# Design Thinking Project

## Designing with Empathy: A solution for the Neurodivergent Community 🧠

Design Thinking is more than just a process; it's about stepping into someone else's shoes to solve their real-world problems.

For our **Technology & Information Systems (SECP1513)** project, my team and I set out to address a specific challenge faced by the **ADHD and Autism community**. Our goal was not just to build a "system," but to create a digital prototype that genuinely alleviates their daily hurdles.

### 🚀 Key Takeaways
This project taught me that the best technical solutions start with deep human understanding. It refined my skills in:
- ✅ Problem Identification & Empathy Mapping.
- ✅ Prototyping & UI/UX Design.
- ✅ Project Management.
